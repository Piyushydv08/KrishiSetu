Frontend
Framework: Next.js (React-based) for server-side rendering and SEO benefits.

Language: TypeScript for type safety and better code maintenance.

Styling: Tailwind CSS for fast, consistent, and responsive UI development.

UI Design:

Clean card-based layouts to display product info, transaction history, and analytics.

Typography using 'PT Sans' for clarity and modernity.

Minimalist icons for supply chain stages and stakeholders.

Smooth animations for transitions and feedback.

Backend
Framework: Express.js for RESTful API design.

Database: MongoDB for flexible document storage (product details, transactions, user data).

Authentication: Firebase Auth for managing user identities securely.

Blockchain Interaction:

Smart contract deployment (Ethereum or Hyperledger).

Node.js libraries like Web3.js or ethers.js to interact with blockchain.

Store blockchain transaction hashes & references in MongoDB to link off-chain and on-chain data.

Implementation Feature Workflow
Product Registration:
Farmers register product batches via frontend forms. Backend stores details in MongoDB and invokes smart contract to log the batch on blockchain, generating a unique batch ID and QR code.

Transaction Recording:
Each transfer (ownership change) triggers a smart contract call to record on blockchain, backend updates MongoDB with transaction metadata for quick access.

QR Code Scanning:
Frontend QR scanner fetches batch ID, queries MongoDB and blockchain data, and displays full product history and provenance details.

Provenance Verification & Interactive Map:
Use stored geo-tags to render an interactive map tracing product journey stages dynamically, backed by verified blockchain transaction logs.

Quality Assurance Display:
Display blockchain-verified certificates and quality checks within product detail cards.

Multi-language Support:
Integrate i18n libraries (e.g., react-i18next) for regional languages.

Market Price Alerts & Reputation System:
Backend cron jobs monitor market APIs and send notifications to users; reputation scores updated based on ratings stored in MongoDB.

Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard:
Use charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js or Recharts) in the admin dashboard for visual insights.

Decentralized Identity & Smart Contract Incentives:
Incorporate DID standards and additional smart contracts for incentives tracking.

Climate Advisory & Emergency Notifications:
Fetch external data APIs for weather/pests and notify users accordingly.

Development Steps Summary
Setup Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS frontend.

Setup Express.js backend with Firebase Auth and MongoDB.

Design & deploy smart contracts on testnet (Ethereum or Hyperledger).

Integrate Web3.js or ethers.js for blockchain calls.

Implement core workflows: product registration, transactions, QR scanning.

Add extra modules: analytics, notifications, reputation, and language support.

Use clear UI/UX with typography, icons, card layout, and animations.
